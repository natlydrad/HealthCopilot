# Parse API: Always restart yourself

When you make changes that affect the parse API (e.g. in `ml-pipeline/nutrition-pipeline/` or anything that would require the API to reload), **restart the parse API yourself**. Do not ask the user to restart.

Run in the background from repo root:

```bash
cd ml-pipeline/nutrition-pipeline && python parse_api.py
```

Use `is_background: true`. Do not say "please restart the parse API" or "you may need to restart"—just run the command.
