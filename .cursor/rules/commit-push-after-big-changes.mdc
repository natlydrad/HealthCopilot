# Commit and push after big changes

When you complete a **logical unit of work**—e.g. a feature is done, a bug is fixed, a refactor is finished, or the user indicates they're done—**commit and push automatically**. Do not ask "should I commit?"; just do it.

## When to commit and push

- After finishing a feature, bugfix, or refactor that the user asked for.
- When the user says they're done, or that something looks good.
- When you've made a coherent set of changes (multiple related edits) and there's a natural stopping point.

## What to do

1. **Stage** the relevant files: `git add` (the files you changed, or `git add -A` if the whole change set is one unit).
2. **Commit** with a short, descriptive message (e.g. "Add parse API auto-restart rule", "Fix portion scaling in lookup_usda").
3. **Push**: `git push` (request **git_write** and **network** permissions when running these commands).

Do not commit after every single tiny edit—only after a completed chunk of work. When in doubt, commit and push at the end of the conversation turn where you finished the task.
