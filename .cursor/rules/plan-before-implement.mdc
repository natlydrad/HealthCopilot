# Plan before implement

When the user asks you to **make a change** (feature, bugfix, refactor, or other modification):

1. **Plan first.** Write out what you will do: which files to touch, what approach you'll take, and the main steps.
2. **Ask for approval.** Present the plan to the user and wait for them to confirm before editing.
3. **Implement only after approval.** Once they say yes (or approve with small tweaks), proceed with the edits.

**Examples of user requests that trigger this:**
- "Add X feature"
- "Fix the Y bug"
- "Change how Z works"
- "Implement the USDA image picker"

**What does NOT require planning first:**
- Simple questions ("how does X work?", "what file does Y?")
- Read-only tasks (audit, search, explain)
- User explicitly says "just do it" or "go ahead" or "implement it" without asking for a plan
- Tiny one-line fixes the user has clearly specified

When in doubt, plan first and ask.
