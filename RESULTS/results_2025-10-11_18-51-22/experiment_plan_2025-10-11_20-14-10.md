# ðŸ§ª Experiments To Run (with scientific justification)


## Goal: â†’ active kcal

### Experiment 1 â€” daily steps (â†‘)
**Source of evidence:** Found in your data (r=0.50, q=0.000). When your daily steps increases, your active kcal tends to increase.
**Your baseline:** 8,342 daily steps.
_Population context:_ daily steps at 8342.0 â†’ â‰ˆ 61áµ—Ê° percentile vs peers (ref Î¼ 7500.0, Ïƒ 3000.0, CDC starter).
_Within typical range â€” moderate improvement may still help._
**Targets (steps):** Week2 = 10,342, Week3 = 11,342, Week4 maintain.

**Design:** Stepped multi-week program (gradual dose).
**Why this design:** Adaptation accumulates over days/weeks; stepped dosing + segmented regression (ITS) captures level/slope changes better than on/off toggles.
**Expected direction:** increase daily steps â†’ lower active kcal.

**What your data so far suggests:**
- Diff-in-means (HAC): increase of 103.55 (p=0.000, n=181).
- ITS: gradual downward trend over time (p=0.031).

**Next steps:**
- Run the full design window. If effects move in the expected direction across â‰¥2 consecutive blocks/weeks, maintain for 2â€“4 more weeks and re-check.
- If no change, pair this lever with another (e.g., earlier bedtime or reduced alcohol) and re-test.

### Experiment 2 â€” VOâ‚‚max (cardio fitness) (â†‘)
**Source of evidence:** Found in your data (r=0.27, q=0.008). When your VOâ‚‚max (cardio fitness) increases, your active kcal tends to increase.
**Your baseline:** 0 VOâ‚‚max (cardio fitness).
_Population context:_ VOâ‚‚max (cardio fitness) at 0.0 â†’ â‰ˆ 0áµ—Ê° percentile vs peers (ref Î¼ 38.5, Ïƒ 7.0, ACSM starter).
_Youâ€™re below typical range â€” this is a corrective experiment._

**Design:** Stepped multi-week program (gradual dose).
**Why this design:** Adaptation accumulates over days/weeks; stepped dosing + segmented regression (ITS) captures level/slope changes better than on/off toggles.
**Expected direction:** increase VOâ‚‚max (cardio fitness) â†’ lower active kcal.

**What your data so far suggests:**
- Diff-in-means (HAC): increase of 67.99 (p=0.000, n=184).
- ITS: immediate increase after ON periods (p=0.000).

**Next steps:**
- Run the full design window. If effects move in the expected direction across â‰¥2 consecutive blocks/weeks, maintain for 2â€“4 more weeks and re-check.
- If no change, pair this lever with another (e.g., earlier bedtime or reduced alcohol) and re-test.

## Goal: â†‘ energy score

### Experiment 1 â€” daily steps (â†‘)
**Source of evidence:** Found in your data (r=0.32, q=0.000). When your daily steps increases, your energy score tends to increase.
**Your baseline:** 8,342 daily steps.
_Population context:_ daily steps at 8342.0 â†’ â‰ˆ 61áµ—Ê° percentile vs peers (ref Î¼ 7500.0, Ïƒ 3000.0, CDC starter).
_Within typical range â€” moderate improvement may still help._
**Targets (steps):** Week2 = 10,342, Week3 = 11,342, Week4 maintain.

**Design:** Stepped multi-week program (gradual dose).
**Why this design:** Adaptation accumulates over days/weeks; stepped dosing + segmented regression (ITS) captures level/slope changes better than on/off toggles.
**Expected direction:** increase daily steps â†’ higher energy score.

**What your data so far suggests:**
- Diff-in-means (HAC): increase of 97.31 (p=0.002, n=181).
- ITS: gradual downward trend over time (p=0.026).

**Next steps:**
- Run the full design window. If effects move in the expected direction across â‰¥2 consecutive blocks/weeks, maintain for 2â€“4 more weeks and re-check.
- If no change, pair this lever with another (e.g., earlier bedtime or reduced alcohol) and re-test.

## Goal: â†‘ rem min
**Why this goal matters:** REM sleep supports memory, emotional regulation, and learning. Low REM can indicate stress or circadian disruption.
**Healthy range:** Adults typically spend 20â€“25% of total sleep in REM (~90â€“120 min/night).
**Other influencing factors:** total sleep, consistent bedtime, exercise, reduced alcohol.

### Experiment 1 â€” daily steps (â†‘)
**Source of evidence:** Found in your data (r=0.30, q=0.010). When your daily steps increases, your rem min tends to increase.
**Your baseline:** 8,342 daily steps.
_Population context:_ daily steps at 8342.0 â†’ â‰ˆ 61áµ—Ê° percentile vs peers (ref Î¼ 7500.0, Ïƒ 3000.0, CDC starter).
_Within typical range â€” moderate improvement may still help._
_Note: your current median rem min is ~103.0; if this is already within the healthy range above, this is an optimization/maintenance experiment rather than corrective._
**Targets (steps):** Week2 = 10,342, Week3 = 11,342, Week4 maintain.

**Design:** Stepped multi-week program (gradual dose).
**Why this design:** Adaptation accumulates over days/weeks; stepped dosing + segmented regression (ITS) captures level/slope changes better than on/off toggles.
**Expected direction:** increase daily steps â†’ higher rem min.

**What your data so far suggests:**
- Diff-in-means (HAC): decrease of 4.20 (p=0.517, n=178).
- ITS: no clear trend yet â€” likely needs more cycles or stronger contrast.

**Next steps:**
- Run the full design window. If effects move in the expected direction across â‰¥2 consecutive blocks/weeks, maintain for 2â€“4 more weeks and re-check.
- If no change, pair this lever with another (e.g., earlier bedtime or reduced alcohol) and re-test.
