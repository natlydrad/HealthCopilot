# ðŸ§ª Experiments To Run (with scientific justification)


## Goal: â†‘ rem min

### Experiment 1 â€” daily steps (â†‘)
**Why this?** Strong association with rem min (r=0.3, q=0.01).

**How to run it:**
- **Design:** stepped dose across **4 weeks** (1wk, 1wk, 1wk, 1wk).
- **Step plan:** 0, 2000, 3000, maintain.
- **Adherence:** Daily steps must exceed baseline by the step goal (+2k or +3k).
- **Instructions:** Week1 baseline; Week2 +2k/day; Week3 +3k/day; Week4 maintain.
- **Expected direction:** increase **daily steps** â†’ higher **rem min**.

**Design justification (real-science vibe):**
- **Onset & carryover:** Behavior changes/fitness adaptation need gradual dosing; segmented regression captures level/slope.
- **Replication & bias control:** design provides repeated contrasts within you; randomization/blocks reduce weekday trends; HAC/ITS handle autocorrelation.
- **Minimum duration:** aim for â‰¥20â€“30 observation days overall to detect moderate effects.

**What your data so far says (informal):**
- Diff-in-means (HAC): effect -4.202 (p=0.517, n=178)
- ITS: level -26.360 (p=0.103), slope +2.745 (p=0.521), adjRÂ²=0.010.
